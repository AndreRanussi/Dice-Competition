# Dice Competition
This is another practice project for JavaScript; here, the idea is that two dice are rolled with a click of a button, and the player with the higher number wins. The original project did not include the functionality of entering each player's name, this was implemented, and the message is personalised to whoever wins.

This project allowed me to practice my CSS and understand more about JavaScript and the DOM.
